first module challenge 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
 
 i have a simple horiseon webpage complete with title and alt tags, i changed the div elements 
 into semantic elements such as nav and section. i changed the classes on each section and streamlined the code by reducing redunant lines in the css file.
